# Project 4 Time Estimate

In our second meeting for this project, we wrote up a feature inventory of things we wanted to add to the game. We gave each feature either Priority 1, Priority 2, or Priority 3. We only estimated time for Priority 1 features, as we didn't want to try to look too far into the future. In the end, we implemented two small Priority 2 features and no Priority 3 features.

Time estimation was done by first assigning each feature to someone who was interested in working on it, then letting that person decide
how long it would take them based on the work they had done in the past.
